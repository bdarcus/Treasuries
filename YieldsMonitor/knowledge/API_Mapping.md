# Treasury Yields Monitor - API Mapping

**Disclaimer:** For personal and educational use only. Data retrieved from public chart services. [Yields](../../shared/knowledge/GLOSSARY.md#yield) represent market mid-prices and may vary by provider.

## Public Data Alternatives
While this tool uses high-resolution (intraday) and real-time data feeds, official daily closing rates can be sourced from:
- **U.S. Treasury Department:** Provides [Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve) (Nominal and Real) via XML/JSON feeds.
- **FRED (St. Louis Fed):** Offers historical data for most Treasury series with a 1-day lag.

## Time Range Mapping

The underlying data provider uses specific `timeRange` parameters that do not always align with the logical span of the data returned. The following mapping is used to provide a consistent user experience:

| UI Label | Provider `timeRange` Parameter | Actual/Observed Span |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2D** | `1D` | Intraday (approx. 2 days) |
| **10D** | `5D` | Recent history (approx. 10 days) |
| **1Y** | `1M` | 1 Year of historical data |
| **2Y** | `3M` | 2 Years of historical data |
| **3Y** | `6M` | 3 Years of historical data |
| **10Y** | `5Y` | 10 Years of historical data |
| **ALL** | `ALL` | Full available history |

# Data Pipeline

Project-wide data acquisition architecture. This document tracks the sources, schedules, and ownership (GitHub vs. Local) of all ingestion jobs.

## 2.0 Ingestion Jobs (Ownership & Schedule)

We have migrated several unreliable GitHub Actions to **Local Windows Scheduled Tasks** to ensure precision. **If a job is marked [LOCAL], it runs on the host machine.**

### [LOCAL] Local Scheduled Tasks (Windows)
These jobs are the primary ingestion engine. They run on the owner's machine via Windows Task Scheduler.

| Task Name | Schedule | Script | Primary Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FedInvest Download** | Weekdays 1:05pm ET | `scripts/getYieldsFedInvest.js` | `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices.csv` |
| **Fidelity Quotes** | 3× Daily | *(Windows Task)* | `FidelityTreasuries.csv` |
| **CPI Refresh** | Monthly (Release Day) | `scripts/fetchRefCpi.js` | `RefCPI.csv` |
| **SA Factor Update** | Daily 6:35am | `YieldCurves/scripts/updateRefCpi.js` | `RefCpiNsaSa.csv` |
| **CPI History Refresh** | Monthly (Release Day) | `scripts/fetchCpiHistory.js` | `bls/CPI_history.csv` |

### [CLOUD] Active GitHub Actions
These jobs still run on GitHub's infrastructure.

| Workflow | Schedule | Script | Primary Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get-auctions.yml` | Weekdays 8:05/10:35am PT | `scripts/getAuctions.js` | `Auctions.csv` |
| `fetch-tips-ref.yml` | Mondays 7am PT | `scripts/fetchTipsRef.js` | `TipsRef.csv` |
| `update-yield-history.yml` | Weekdays 11am PT | `YieldsMonitor/scripts/snapHistory.js` | `yield-history/` |

## 2.0 Ingestion Jobs (Ownership & Schedule)

All ingestion jobs have been migrated to **Local Windows Scheduled Tasks** to ensure precision and reliability.

### [LOCAL] Local Scheduled Tasks (Windows)
These jobs run on the host machine via Windows Task Scheduler.

| Task Name | Schedule | Script | Primary Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FedInvest Download** | Weekdays 1:05pm ET | `scripts/getYieldsFedInvest.js` | `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices.csv` |
| **Fidelity Quotes** | 3× Daily | *(Windows Task)* | `FidelityTreasuries.csv` |
| **Auction Refresh** | Weekdays 8:05/10:35am PT | `scripts/getAuctions.js` | `Auctions.csv` |
| **TIPS Ref Refresh** | Mondays 7am PT | `scripts/fetchTipsRef.js` | `TipsRef.csv` |
| **Yield History Snap** | Weekdays 11am PT | `YieldsMonitor/scripts/snapHistory.js` | `yield-history/` |
| **Ref CPI Refresh** | 8:35 AM ET on each BLS release date | `scripts/fetchRefCpi.js` (`run-ref-cpi.cmd`) | `TIPS/RefCPI.csv` |
| **SA Factor Update** | Daily 6:35am | `YieldCurves/scripts/updateRefCpi.js` | `RefCpiNsaSa.csv` |
| **CPI History Refresh** | 8:35 AM ET on each BLS release date | `scripts/fetchCpiHistory.js` (`run-cpi-history.cmd`) | `bls/CPI_history.csv` |

**CPI release date triggers:** `RefCPI` and `FetchCpiHistory` tasks use date-specific `Once` triggers (not a daily poll). Triggers are set by `scripts/setup-cpi-release-tasks.ps1`, which reads `bls/CpiReleaseSchedule{year}.csv` from R2 and registers one trigger per release date. A `RefreshCpiTasks` task runs Dec 29 each year to reload the next year's schedule and self-reschedule. Re-run the script manually if the schedule changes.

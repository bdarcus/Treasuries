## TIPS-Specific Terms

**TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities):** Marketable Treasury securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index.

- **[Quantity](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#quantity):** Number of TIPS held; qty 1 = $1,000 face value (e.g., qty 50 = $50,000 face value).
- **[Face Value](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#face-value):** Quantity × $1,000 (e.g., $50,000).
- **[Par Value (Adjusted Principal)](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#par-value-adjusted):** The principal value after being adjusted for inflation/deflation.
  - `Par Value = Face Value × Index Ratio`
  - This is the value used to calculate interest payments and the redemption amount at maturity.

**CPI-U (NSA):** Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Non-Seasonally Adjusted.
- Published monthly by Bureau of Labor Statistics.
- Released mid-month for prior month data.

- **[Reference CPI](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#ref-cpi):** Daily interpolated value used for TIPS calculations.
  - **Legal Authority:** 31 CFR § 356 Appendix B, Section I, Paragraph B.
  - **Principle:** The Reference CPI for the first day of any month is the CPI-U (NSA) for the third month preceding that month.

```
For the 1st of the month:
  Ref CPI(month, 1) = CPI-U(month - 3)
  Example: Ref CPI for April 1st uses the CPI-U for January.

For days 2-31:
  Ref CPI(month, day) = Ref CPI(month, 1) + 
                       (Ref CPI(month+1, 1) - Ref CPI(month, 1)) * 
                       (day - 1) / daysInMonth
```

**Dated Date:** 15th of the month in which TIPS was issued.

**Ref CPI on Dated Date:** Reference CPI on the dated date (constant for bond lifetime).

- **[Index Ratio](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#index-ratio):**
```
indexRatio(date) = refCPI(date) / refCPI(datedDate)
```

## Inflation-Adjusted Calculations

**Par Value (Adjusted Principal):**
```
parValue = faceValue * indexRatio
```

**Inflation-Adjusted Annual Interest (per TIPS):**
```
adjustedAnnualInterest = Par Value * couponRate
```

**Inflation-Adjusted Semi-Annual Interest:**
```
adjustedSemiAnnualInterest = adjustedAnnualInterest / 2
```

---

## TIPS-Specific Rules

**TIPS Maturity Dates:** Always 15th of month (Jan, Feb, Apr, Jul, Oct).

**Last-Year Interest (TIPS):**
- Jan-Jun maturity: 1 payment in final year
- Jul-Dec maturity: 2 payments in final year
```
For Jan maturity (month 1 < 7):
  lastYearInterest = adjustedAnnualInterest * 0.5

For Jul maturity (month 7 \u2265 7):
  lastYearInterest = adjustedAnnualInterest * 1.0
```

**[P+I per TIPS](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#pi-per-tips):**
The total inflation-adjusted cash flow (Par Value + Last-Year Interest) received in the year the security matures.
```
piPerBond = Par Value + lastYearInterest
```

**[Cost per TIPS](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#cost-per-tips):**
The nominal cost to purchase one $1,000 Face Value unit.
```
costPerBond = price/100 × indexRatio × 1,000
```

## Yield Calculation Conventions

TIPS yield-to-maturity (YTM) follows the standard U.S. Treasury convention for notes and bonds:

- **Standard ( > 6 months to maturity)**: Semi-annual compounding (Actual/Actual day count). Matches Excel's `YIELD` function with `frequency=2` and `basis=1`.
- **Short-dated ( ≤ 6 months to maturity)**: Simple annual discounting (single-period). This occurs when the security is within its final coupon period.
  - **Rule**: If the time from settlement to maturity is less than one semi-annual period (approximately 182.5 days), use the single-period formula.
  - **Formula**:
    \[ Price_{dirty} = \frac{FaceValue + Coupon_{semi}}{1 + Yield \times \frac{DaysToMaturity}{DaysInYear}} \]
    where $DaysInYear$ is 365 (or 366 if a leap day is involved).

This dual-mode calculation ensures that the application's yield curve aligns with official Treasury (FedInvest) and institutional broker data.

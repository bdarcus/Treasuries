## 4.0 Financial Composites & Formulas

**TIPS Elements**

### <a id="ref-cpi"></a>Ref CPI
`Ref_CPI` = *Daily interpolated Consumer Price Index (CPI-U NSA) value used for TIPS calculations. Authority: 31 CFR § 356 Appendix B.*
- **Dated:** `Ref_CPI_dated` — Reference CPI on the TIPS Dated Date (constant for the bond's lifetime)
- **Settle:** `Ref_CPI_settle` — Reference CPI on the Settlement Date

### <a id="index-ratio"></a>Index Ratio
`Index_Ratio` = `Ref_CPI_settle / Ref_CPI_dated`

### <a id="par-value-adjusted"></a>Par Value (Adjusted)
`Par_Value_Adjusted` = `Face_Value × Index_Ratio` *(inflation-adjusted principal, also called Adjusted Principal)*

### <a id="annual-interest-real"></a>Annual Interest (Real)
`Annual_Interest_Real` = `Face_Value × Coupon_Rate` *(coupon applied to fixed face value — constant in real terms)*

### <a id="annual-interest-nominal"></a>Annual Interest (Nominal)
`Annual_Interest_Nominal` = `Par_Value_Adjusted × Coupon_Rate` *(coupon applied to inflation-adjusted principal)*

### <a id="pi-per-tips"></a>P+I per TIPS
`P+I_per_TIPS` = `Par_Value_Adjusted + (Annual_Interest_Nominal × [0.5 | 1.0])` *Total inflation-adjusted cash flow in the maturity year. See TIPS_Basics.md for half-year rule.*

### <a id="cost-per-tips"></a>Cost per TIPS
`Cost_per_TIPS` = `(Price / 100) × Index_Ratio × 1000` *(nominal cost to purchase one $1,000 face-value unit)*

---

**Ladder & Portfolio Elements**

### <a id="funded-year"></a>Funded Year
`Funded_Year` = *Calendar year (rung) in the ladder for which total cash flow is calculated*

### <a id="ladder-period"></a>Ladder Period
`Ladder_Period` = `First_Year + ... + Last_Year`

### <a id="daa"></a>DAA
`DAA` = *Desired Annual Amount: target total cash flow for a funded year in nominal terms (generic bond ladders)*

### <a id="aa"></a>AA
`AA` = *Annual Amount: actual cash flow produced for a funded year in nominal terms. May differ from DAA due to rounding.*

### <a id="dara"></a>DARA
`DARA` = *Desired Annual Real Amount: target total cash flow for a funded year in real (inflation-adjusted) terms (TIPS ladders)*

### <a id="ara"></a>ARA
`ARA` = `P+I_per_TIPS + LMI` *(Actual Real Amount: total real cash flow produced for a Funded Year)*

### <a id="lmi"></a>LMI
`LMI` = `Σ Annual_Interest_Real for TIPS maturing in years > Current_Year` *(Later Maturity Interest: interest contributions to the current funded year from bonds maturing in future years)*

### <a id="gap-years"></a>Gap Years
`Gap_Years` = *Funded Years within the ladder period where no Treasury TIPS exist (currently 2037, 2038, 2039)*

### <a id="synthetic-tips"></a>Synthetic TIPS
`Synthetic_TIPS` = *Theoretical TIPS constructed for Gap Years. Yield interpolated from surrounding real maturities; index ratio = 1.0; price = 100.*

### <a id="bracket-year"></a>Bracket Year
`Bracket_Year` = *Existing TIPS maturity used to fund or bracket a Gap Year*

---

**Seasonal Adjustment (SA) Elements**

### <a id="sa-factor"></a>SA Factor
`SA_Factor` = `CPI_NSA / CPI_SA` *(multiplicative factor derived from BLS CPI-U NSA vs SA series; normalizes for seasonal inflation patterns)*

### <a id="sa-yield"></a>SA Yield
`SA_Yield` = *Real yield derived from a Seasonally Adjusted Clean Price. Removes predictable seasonal CPI inflation carry from the raw YTM.*

### <a id="sao-yield"></a>SAO Yield
`SAO_Yield` = *SA Yield with additional Outlier adjustment. Produced by backwards-anchored linear regression blending of the SA curve; smooths idiosyncratic front-end "wiggles".*

### <a id="sacp"></a>SACP
`SACP` = *Seasonally Adjusted Clean Price (Canty 2009, Eq. 14 approximation): `SACP ≈ CP × (S_settle / S_maturity)`. Strips predictable seasonal carry from the quoted clean price.*

### <a id="facp"></a>FACP
`FACP` = *Fully Adjusted Clean Price (Canty 2009, Eq. 21): `FACP = CP × (S_settle / S_maturity) × (1 / O_maturity)`. Strips both seasonal carry and one-off outlier shocks. Provides the cleanest "trend" price for relative value analysis.*

### <a id="sa-anchor"></a>SA Anchor
`SA_Anchor` = *Long-end region of the SAO curve where SAO = SA (bonds with maturity > 7 years, or the last 4 bonds in the series). Yields in this region are considered stable; no trend blending applied.*

### <a id="sliding-window"></a>Sliding Window
`Sliding_Window` = *4-bond window of longer-maturity bonds used to compute a linear regression trend line in the SAO algorithm. Applied as the algorithm sweeps from the anchor region toward shorter maturities.*

### <a id="blend-weights"></a>Blend Weights
`Blend_Weights` = *`trendWeight` values controlling how much of the SAO yield comes from the projected trend vs. the bond's actual SA yield. Vary by time-to-maturity: 90% trend (< 0.5y), 15% (0.5–2y), 25% (2–5y), 20% (> 5y non-anchor).*

### <a id="iqr-clip"></a>IQR Clip
`IQR_Clip` = *Y-axis floor applied to the Treasuries chart tab to suppress near-maturity Notes with extreme negative YTM. Floor = Q1 − max(1.0 × IQR, 0.5%) computed from positive-yield Notes values only. Does not remove data points — only adjusts the visible axis scale. Upper bound unconstrained.*

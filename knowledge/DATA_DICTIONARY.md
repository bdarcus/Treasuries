## 1.0 External Entities (E)
*External sources providing data to the system. Click these in the Context Diagram to see their data structures.*

- <a id="e1"></a>**E1: FedInvest** = `CUSIP + Security_Type + Maturity_Date + Rate + Price`
  *US Treasury price source. Price represents the **midpoint of market bid and ask prices** (mid-market reference). Because it is a midpoint, it is consistently lower than commercial market Ask prices, resulting in calculated FedInvest yields that are slightly higher than broker Ask yields. This is particularly noticeable for short-dated Bills. Note: FedInvest does not specify a settlement date; our system infers T=0 (Price Date = Settlement Date) based on empirical yield matching. We calculate the Yield (YTM) based on this price.*
- <a id="e2"></a>**E2: TreasuryDirect SecIndex** = `CUSIP + Index_Date + Ref_CPI`
  *Authority for daily interpolated RefCPI. Provides values for every day of the month.*
- <a id="e3"></a>**E3: FiscalData API** = `CUSIP + Auction_Date + Security_Type + High_Yield + Bid_to_Cover + ...`
  *U.S. Treasury official auction results and immutable security metadata (Coupons, Dated Dates).*
- <a id="e4"></a>**E4: BLS Public API** = `Year + Month + Value + Seasonal_Adjustment_Flag`
  *Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) monthly data. Used to derive SA factors by comparing NSA vs. SA values.*
- <a id="e5"></a>**E5: CNBC GraphQL** = `Symbol + Timestamp + Price + Change + Yield`
  *Market mid-price feed for live monitoring. Symbols include US10Y, US30Y, etc.*
- <a id="e6"></a>**E6: Fidelity Fixed Income** = `CUSIP + Maturity + Coupon + Price_Bid + Price_Ask + Yield_Bid + Ask_Yield_to_Maturity + ( Inflation_Factor + Adjusted_Price_Bid + Adjusted_Price_Ask ) + Quantity`
  *Broker bid/ask quotes. Used for "Market Price" comparisons and bid/ask spread analysis. Two files: one for TIPS (includes inflation-adjustment columns), one for Nominals (includes quantity columns). Column names are as they appear in the exported CSV header row (used verbatim for parsing).*

<a id="2.0-data-stores-s"></a>
## 2.0 Data Stores (S)

  *Full monthly BLS CPI-U history from January 1913 to present. NSA = `CUUR0000SA0`; SA = `CUSR0000SA0`. SA blank before 1947. R2 key: `bls/CPI_history.csv`.*

- <a id="s7a"></a>**S7a: FidelityTips.csv** — TIPS bid/ask quotes. Local drop path: `YieldCurves/data/FidelityTips.csv` (gitignored). R2 key: `Treasuries/FidelityTips.csv`.

  *Parser normalises headers to lowercase. Key fields used: `cusip`, `price ask` (ask clean real price), `price bid` (bid clean real price), `inflation factor`, `adjusted price bid`, `adjusted price ask`. Bid yield is computed from `price bid` via `yieldFromPrice` (not from `yield bid`) to ensure consistency with ask yield method. Price spread uses adjusted prices (actual dollar cost). Footer line `Date downloaded MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PM` supplies the download timestamp.*

- <a id="s7b"></a>**S7b: FidelityTreasuries.csv** — Nominal Treasury bid/ask quotes. Local drop path: `YieldCurves/data/FidelityTreasuries.csv` (gitignored). R2 key: `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuries.csv`.
  CSV columns (exact header names): `Cusip, State, Description, Coupon, Maturity Date, Moody's Rating, S&P Rating, Price Bid, Price Ask, Yield Bid, Ask Yield to Worst, Ask Yield to Maturity, Quantity Bid(min), Quantity Ask(min), Attributes`
  *Parser normalises headers to lowercase. Key fields used: `cusip`, `price ask`, `price bid`, `yield bid` (bid yield, percentage form — divide by 100), `ask yield to maturity` (ask yield, percentage form). Spread: `yield_spread_bps = (yield_bid − ask_ytm) × 10000`; `price_spread_pct = (price_ask − price_bid) / price_ask × 100`. Footer line `Date downloaded ...` supplies the download timestamp.*

Exception: For FedInvest price ingestion, yield calculations use T=0 (Price Date = Settlement Date) to match FedInvest reported yields empirically.

<a id="funded-year"></a>
### Funded Year
`Funded_Year` = *Calendar year (rung) in the ladder for which total cash flow is calculated*

<a id="ladder-period"></a>
### Ladder Period
`Ladder_Period` = `First_Year + ... + Last_Year`

<a id="daa"></a>
### DAA
`DAA` = *Desired Annual Amount: target total cash flow for a funded year in nominal terms (generic bond ladders)*

<a id="aa"></a>
### AA
`AA` = *Annual Amount: actual cash flow produced for a funded year in nominal terms. May differ from DAA due to rounding.*

<a id="dara"></a>
### DARA
`DARA` = *Desired Annual Real Amount: target total cash flow for a funded year in real (inflation-adjusted) terms (TIPS ladders)*

<a id="ara"></a>
### ARA
`ARA` = `Funded_PI + LMI + Role_Playing_LMI` *(Actual Real Amount: total real cash flow produced for a Funded Year)*

<a id="lmi"></a>
### LMI
`LMI` = `Σ Annual_Interest_Real for TIPS maturing in years > Current_Year` *(Later Maturity Interest: interest contributions to the current funded year from bonds maturing in future years)*

<a id="role-playing-lmi"></a>
### Role Playing LMI
`Role_Playing_LMI` = `Σ Annual_Interest_Real for bracket or cover excess bonds maturing in Current_Year`
*When bracket or cover TIPS of a given maturity substitute for TIPS that haven't yet been issued (gap years or future 30-year rungs), they "role play" by contributing their annual interest to the funded year amount for that maturity. Example: If excess Feb 2056s are held to cover future 30-year rungs (e.g., 2057–2066), the interest from those excess 2056 TIPS contributes to the 2056 funded year amount, which could reduce the quantity of 2056 TIPS required for the 2056 funded year.*

<a id="gap-years"></a>
### Gap Years
`Gap_Years` = *Funded Years within the ladder period where no Treasury TIPS exist (currently 2037, 2038, 2039)*

<a id="bracket-year"></a>
### Bracket Year
`Bracket_Year` = *Existing TIPS maturity used to fund or bracket a Gap Year*

**Seasonal Adjustment (SA) Elements**

<a id="sa-factor"></a>
### SA Factor

<a id="sa-yield"></a>
### SA Yield
`SA_Yield` = *Real yield derived from a Seasonally Adjusted Clean Price. Removes predictable seasonal CPI inflation carry from the raw YTM.*

<a id="sao-yield"></a>
### SAO Yield
`SAO_Yield` = *SA Yield with additional Outlier adjustment. Produced by backwards-anchored linear regression blending of the SA curve; smooths idiosyncratic front-end "wiggles".*

<a id="sacp"></a>
### SACP
`SACP` = *Seasonally Adjusted Clean Price (Canty 2009, Eq. 14 approximation): `SACP ≈ CP × (S_settle / S_maturity)`. Strips predictable seasonal carry from the quoted clean price.*

<a id="facp"></a>
### FACP
`FACP` = *Fully Adjusted Clean Price (Canty 2009, Eq. 21): `FACP = CP × (S_settle / S_maturity) × (1 / O_maturity)`. Strips both seasonal carry and one-off outlier shocks. Provides the cleanest "trend" price for relative value analysis.*

<a id="sa-anchor"></a>
### SA Anchor
`SA_Anchor` = *Long-end region of the SAO curve where SAO = SA (bonds with maturity > 7 years, or the last 4 bonds in the series). Yields in this region are considered stable; no trend blending applied.*

<a id="sliding-window"></a>
### Sliding Window
`Sliding_Window` = *4-bond window of longer-maturity bonds used to compute a linear regression trend line in the SAO algorithm. Applied as the algorithm sweeps from the anchor region toward shorter maturities.*

<a id="blend-weights"></a>
### Blend Weights
`Blend_Weights` = *`trendWeight` values controlling how much of the SAO yield comes from the projected trend vs. the bond's actual SA yield. Vary by time-to-maturity: 90% trend (< 0.5y), 15% (0.5–2y), 25% (2–5y), 20% (> 5y non-anchor).*

<a id="iqr-clip"></a>
### IQR Clip
`IQR_Clip` = *Y-axis floor applied to the Treasuries chart tab to suppress near-maturity Notes with extreme negative YTM. Floor = Q1 − max(1.0 × IQR, 0.5%) computed from positive-yield Notes values only. Does not remove data points — only adjusts the visible axis scale. Upper bound unconstrained.*

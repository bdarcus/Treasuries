# YieldCurves (App Overview)

**YieldCurves** is a tool for analyzing TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) real yields through the lens of seasonal and outlier adjustments. It provides a more accurate "fair value" curve by removing predictable inflation noise and idiosyncratic market shocks.

## 2.0 Core Processes

### [1.0 Seasonal Adjustment (SA)](../YieldCurves/knowledge/1.0_Seasonal_Adjustments.md)
Normalizes real yields by applying seasonal factors derived from BLS CPI-U (NSA vs SA) data.
- **Goal**: Enable "fair" comparison of yields across different months of the year.
- **Formula**: `SA Yield = Clean Price * (S_settle / S_maturity)`

### [2.0 SAO Outlier Adjustment](../YieldCurves/knowledge/2.0_SAO_Adjustment.md)
Applies a backwards-anchored linear regression to smooth the front-end of the SA curve.
- **Goal**: Remove idiosyncratic "wiggles" caused by liquidity or one-off shocks to specific CUSIPs.
- **Method**: Blending the SA yield with a projected trend line.

### [3.0 Interactive Visualization](../YieldCurves/knowledge/3.0_Visual_Standards.md)
A high-performance charting interface built with Chart.js and Hammer.js.
- **Features**: Full X/Y zoom, vertical panning, and dataset visibility toggles.
- **Visual Priority**: SAO > SA > Ask (Market).

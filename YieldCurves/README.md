# YieldCurves: TIPS Seasonal Adjustments

A browser-based tool for analyzing **Seasonally Adjusted (SA)** and **SA Outlier-adjusted (SAO)** TIPS yields. This project helps identify "cheap" or "rich" spots on the TIPS curve by removing predictable seasonal inflation noise.

## Features
- **Interactive Yield Curve**: Compare Market Ask, SA, and SAO yields.
- **Broker Integration**: Upload Schwab or Fidelity CSVs to see your own quotes adjusted.
- **Drill-down Transparency**: Click any SA yield to see the exact multiplicative factor and adjustment math.
- **SAO Trend Fitting**: See the institutional view of the yield curve via backwards-anchored linear regression.

## Getting Started
To get started, visit the [Treasury Investors Portal](https://aerokam.github.io/Treasuries/) and select the **YieldCurves** tool, or go directly to the [YieldCurves URL](https://aerokam.github.io/Treasuries/YieldCurves/).

## Local Development
